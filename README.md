# Joplin debug tool

This plugin adds a panel that shows information about the selected notes(s). At present, this information isn't very user-friendly â€” it's presented roughly as fetched from Joplin's data API.

# Features

## Note info panel

This plugin adds a "note info" panel to Joplin's UI. The panel can be hidden by going to View > Show/Hide note info. 

The fields shown in the plugin are a subset of the fields [stored for different items in Joplin's database](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/lib/services/database/types.ts).

## Regular expression search

At the bottom of the info panel is a "search" dropdown:

By default, the search tool contained in the dropdown uses a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to search through notes' `title` and `body` fields. The fields and type of item can be customized using the options in the "Advanced" dropdown.

A search scans Joplin's database and results are in the order returned by Joplin's [data API](https://joplinapp.org/help/api/references/rest_api/).
